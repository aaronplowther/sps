# Simultaneous predictor selection

This purpose of this repository is to make all of the methodology developed in my [thesis](http://www.research.lancs.ac.uk/portal/en/publications/multivariate-response-predictor-selection-methods(08cef01d-1717-473d-a413-1aedc7e424c2).html) publicly available. Some of this work appears in [this](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11222-020-09970-6) article.

Please bear with me whilst I update this repository. At this stage I have implemented the simultaneous predictor selection methods, but I have not yet included the two-stage procedure.
